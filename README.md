  <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
<p> I am a <a href = "https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows/people/?type=junior">Junior Fellow</a> of the Simons Society of Fellows hosted by <a href = "https://www.columbia.edu/~dl3133/">Daniel Lacker</a> at Columbia University. I obtained my PhD in applied mathematics at Brown University under the supervision of <a href = "https://appliedmath.brown.edu/people/kavita-ramanan">Kavita Ramanan</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research interests lie at the intersection of probability theory, partial differential equations, and mathematical physics. My doctoral thesis focuses on understanding propagation of chaos and long-time dynamics of strongly interacting particle systems using tools from stochastic analysis, random graph theory, and partial differential equations. A short general audience talk about my research can be found <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2yfnAhQmWA">here</a>.
