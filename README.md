I am a Junior Fellow of the Simons Society of Fellows hosted by [Daniel Lacker](https://www.columbia.edu/~dl3133/) at Columbia University. I obtained my PhD in applied mathematics at Brown University under the supervision of Kavita Ramanan.

My research interests lie at the intersection of probability theory, partial differential equations, and mathematical physics. My doctoral thesis focuses on understanding propagation of chaos and long-time dynamics of strongly interacting particle systems using tools from stochastic analysis, random graph theory, and partial differential equations. A short general audience talk about my research can be found here.
